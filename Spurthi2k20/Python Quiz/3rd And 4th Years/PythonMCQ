a) [0xFF, 255, 16, 255]
b) (‘0xff’, 155, 16, 255)
c) Error
d) (‘0xff’, 255, 255)
d 

2. The output of the two codes shown below is the same.

i. bin((2**16)-1)
ii. '{}'.format(bin((2**16)-1))
a) True
b) False
a 

3. Which of these is not true about recursion?
a) Making the code look clean
b) A complex task can be broken into sub-problems
c) Recursive calls take up less memory
d) Sequence generation is easier than a nested iteration
c 

4. Which of these is not true about recursion?
a) It’s easier to code some real-world problems using recursion than non-recursive equivalent
b) Recursive functions are easy to debug
c) Recursive calls take up a lot of memory
d) Programs using recursion take longer time than their non-recursive equivalent
b 

5. Read the following Python code carefully and point out the global variables?

y, z = 1, 2
def f():
    global x
    x = y+z
a) x
b) y and z
c) x, y and z
d) Neither x, nor y, nor z
c 

6. What will be the output of the following Python code?

def a(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return a(n-1)+a(n-2)
for i in range(0,4):
    print(a(i),end=" ")
a) 0 1 2 3
b) An exception is thrown
